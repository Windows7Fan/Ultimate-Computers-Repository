<h1>⚠️THINGS TO KNOW⚠️</h1>

<h3>
You can only have one program at a time on the Ultimate Build Computer
so if you install a program, it will overwrite the previous one.
</h3>

<h3>
To Install a program you need to bring out the program tool and click 
on the variable on the front of the computer that says "Package Name"
once you clicked that, find the program you want in the packages folder 
of this repository and type the name of the package and DONT add the file 
extension.
</h3>

<h3>
Once you have done that, find the blue button next to the variable that 
says "Install Package" and click that, it should have installed once 
you clicked that and then you press the power button and enjoy your 
installed package.
